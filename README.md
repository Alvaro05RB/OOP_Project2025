# OOP_Project2025

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.  
It implements a matchmaking system using Java and MySQL, allowing the creation and management of tournaments, teams, and players. Following object-oriented design principles and persistence with Hibernate.

## Features
- Create and manage tournaments with configurable settings  
- Register teams and individual players  
- Match players and teams automatically based on defined criteria  
- Store and retrieve tournament data using MySQL and Hibernate ORM  
- Object-oriented architecture with modular class design  
- Dockerized database setup for local testing and deployment

## My Contribution
This was a group project, and my main contributions included:
- Designed and implemented the core model classes: `Player`, `User`, and `Admin`  
- Developed the `UserController`, including user authentication features (`login`, `logout`, `signup`)  
- Ensured integration between the user layer and database through Hibernate  
- Collaborated in debugging and testing the persistence layer
